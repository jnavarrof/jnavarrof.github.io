*This update was October 28th, 2018*


Born in Barcelona, Spain, I am currently living an awesome experience in Cambridge, United Kingdom; a beautiful city where there is always something to see and do. 

For those curious, here is what I am working on:

* Working at the HPC Services Department (University of Cambridge)
* Meeting awesome professionals and really good people
* Creating this page
* Allways biking to work, restarting my strength training, clean eating, not clean eating

These are the things currently occupying my attention in no particular order…
Currently reading: Team Dog: How to Train Your Dog–the Navy SEAL Way by Mike Ritland which I keep starting and and then stopping off and on. Not sure why. When I pick it up, I do find some great takeaways. I like the author’s approach which is that training the human is the key to training the dog. If your dog is not listening, following commands, etc. that’s a problem with you, not the dog. Going to try to finish it this time.
