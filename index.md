I consider myself a creative, and proactive System Engineer. I have a wide experience in both High-Performance Computing and Cloud environments. A team-oriented professional who works effectively in cross-disciplinary teams.

My fulltime job is Systems Engineer at the University of Cambridge. Feel free to contact me whether you want to discuss potential projects or need any help.
